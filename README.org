  This chapter notes ideas for future implementation.

  * [ ] find a better name than correct-submissions
  * [ ] change upload_comment and grade_submission to take the assignment object by extracting the assignment object outside of the function. There is no need to pass all assignment to the function.
  * [ ] change plotting according to Kenny' suggestions
  * [ ] rewrite bcolors to be functions that appends and prepends rather than being plain strings
  * [ ] Instantiate assignment directories based on absalon assignments including the /submissions/ folder
  * [ ] Common example usecases e.g. how to correct a single student/assignment etc.
  * [ ] Move assignments to a single folder called *assignments* for easier iteration through each assignment
  * [ ] insert title in plagiarism check at mossum when PR has been accepted.
  * [ ] in [[file:grade_submissions.py]] implement the config.ini for uploading scores instead if grade
  * [X] Put Valgrind somewhere else or let it be part of the code supplied by course admin as it does not strictly belong in the framework
  * [-] Setup script:
    This script should go through all the necessary steps to start running the code checking
    1. [X] enter token
    2. [X] check validity of token
    3. [X] enter course id
    4. [X] setup assignments folders according to the assignments on absalon
    5. [X] Enter points required for completing each assignment
    6. [X] Upload scores or not i.e. is the assignments scored or simply passed/failed
    7. [ ] What files to uploads i.e. give filenames or regex
  * [X] Put Valgrind somewhere else of let it be part of the code supplied by course admin as it does not strictly belong in the framework
  * [X] Config-related
    - #[-] add allowance for late submission or marked as failed in config --- Not necessary as this should be set in absalon for each assignment
    - [X] Should token be in the config?
    - [X] in [[file:grade_submissions.py]] change scores to be read from config files
    - [X] read url and courses from config
  * [X] change all uses of apiurl and apikey
  * [X] check up on 'students_passed' not defined error
  * [X] put everything into 'mains'
    - [X] download_submissions.py
    - [X] grade_submissions.py
    - [X] plot_scores.py
    - [X] upload_comments.py
  * [X] Ability to choose what assignments to download and/or specific students
  * [X] What assignment to correct
  * [X] When plotting iterate through all assignments and add empty violin of no one handed in yet
  * [X] when checking new assignments in download_assignments - check on assignment name and comment name/hash
  * [X] change submissions_correcting to only have to run a single bash script called "main"
  * [X] write config files where default params reside
