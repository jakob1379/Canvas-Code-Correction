  This chapter notes ideas for future implementation.
  * [ ] Make sure all methods are documented

    - [ ] [[file:canvas_helpers.py::37][file_to_string]]
    - [ ] [[file:canvas_helpers.py::43][print_dict]]
    - [ ] [[file:canvas_helpers.py::50][print_as_dict]]

    - [ ] [[file:upload_comments.py::48][upload_comments]]
  * [ ] Setup script:
    This script should go through all the necessary steps to start running the code checking
    1. [ ] enter token
    2. [ ] check validity of token
    3. [ ] enter course id
    4. [ ] setup assignments folders according to the assignments on absalon
    5. [ ] Enter points required for completing each assignment
    6. [ ] Upload scores or not i.e. is the assignments scored or simply passed/failed
  * [ ] Instantiate assignment directories based on absalon assignments including the /submissions/ folder
  * [ ] Common example usecases e.g. how to correct a single student/assignment etc.
  * [-] Config-related
    - [ ] add allowance for late submission or marked as failed in config
    - [X] Should token be in the config?
    - [X] in [[file:grade_submissions.py]] change scores to be read from config files
    - [X] read url and courses from config
  * [X] change all uses of apiurl and apikey
  * [X] check up on 'students_passed' not defined error
  * [X] put everything into 'mains'
    - [X] download_submissions.py
    - [X] grade_submissions.py
    - [X] plot_scores.py
    - [X] upload_comments.py
  * [X] Ability to choose what assignments to download and/or specific students
  * [X] What assignment to correct
  * [X] When plotting iterate through all assignments and add empty violin of no one handed in yet
  * [X] when checking new assignments in download_assignments - check on assignment name and comment name/hash
  * [X] change submissions_correcting to only have to run a single bash script called "main"
  * [X] write config files where default params reside
